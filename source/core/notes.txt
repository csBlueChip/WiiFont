I'm really unhappy with the code that implements a hook.  It's just plain ugly!
If anyone has a better suggestion, I'm (as 'they' say) "all ears"

<BlueChip> Is this the right place to find someone who understands the GX calls?
           If so, I have a texture which I want to display - but I want to draw
           it such that every which is opaque is reduced to black and opacity is
           multiplied by (0 < N <= 1) ...I think it should be possible via GX,
           but I really don't know how
<BlueChip> *every pixel
<+comex>   BlueChip_: what?
<BlueChip> i have a texture with a colourful square on it with a hole in the
           middle ...I wish to display it but every colour must be black and
           opacity must be changed by a factor
<rewt``>   ala wallhack?
<BlueChip> is that at me?
<rewt``>   yes
<BlueChip> googling "wallhack"...
<+comex>   http://www.amnoid.de/gc/tev.html
<BlueChip> I'm actually generating a 2d drop-shadow, but I guess it is no
           dissimilar to a wallhack
<rewt``>   it's a term in gaming where they use a hack to turn walls translucent
           to see enemies behind the walls
<+comex>   it's probably a trivial application of that
<BlueChip> comex: can you suggest which part of that page would be the most
           helpful bit for me?
<+comex>   from libogc's GX_SetTevOp

<+comex>   GX_SetTevColorOp(tevstage,GX_TEV_ADD,GX_TB_ZERO,GX_CS_SCALE_1,GX_TRUE,GX_TEVPREV);
<rewt``>   BlueChip_, look for "alpha"
<BlueChip> thanks, I will read and try to understand :)
<rewt``>   that's the opacity/translucency setting
<+comex>   or just
<+comex>   case GX_REPLACE:
<+comex>   GX_SetTevColorIn(tevstage,GX_CC_ZERO,GX_CC_ZERO,GX_CC_ZERO,GX_CC_TEXC);
<+comex>   change the last one to GX_CC_ZERO
<BlueChip> Thanks guys.  I'm gonna get a cuppa and set to work /now/ :)
<+comex>   and modify the alphain after that so that you get the multiplication you want

<BlueChip> I'm very new to the likes of GX (DX/GL/etc) ...so I could be a while,
           whilst I make sure I not only do this, but understand it too :) ...
           speak soon
