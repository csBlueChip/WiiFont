# WiiFont is a free (as in free) font library which was originally developed for the Wii HomeBrew scene, but is highly portable!

# Full colour animated fonts can be added to your apps and games in minutes.

# For more technical information, watch the release demo and/or read its source code.

# FreeType for Wii requires 2 Megs of RAM, WiiFont needs less than 13K

# You can have as many fonts loaded as you have spare RAM and each of them can have private and/or shared animations.

# The library is written in about 1400 lines of excellently commented 'C'.

# There are currently a total of SIX hook points to allow complex and compound real-time font animations.

# Support for \n \t and \r (half-height linefeed).

# The "wobbly" text is a demo "hook" written in 3 (THREE) lines of code (*including* the variable declaration and the return statement).

# The looped-sine-scroller is not an integral part of WiiFont, just an additional block of code you can use.  It can support as many strings as you desire, and each can be windowed in a different place on the screen.

# [Well, this never happened!] In the pipeline are draw'ers which will allow you to Zoom, Rotate and/or Render text to a texture... Align-to-baseline/ascender/descender is planned ...Proper tab-stop points, Multi-page font support and Native TPL support are also on my todo list

# I'm bored now and need to sort out clipping before I can release this code - write something cool people :)
